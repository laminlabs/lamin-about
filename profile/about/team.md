# Team

We're a core team of 2 people:

- [Sunny Sun](https://github.com/sunnyosun): Biology across the dry and wet lab since 2012. Focus on genome engineering & cell biology in health & disease.
- [Alex Wolf](https://falexwolf.me): Scientific computing & software since 2009. Created Scanpy & led build-up of a compute platform for drug discovery.

We're closely collaborating with [Sergei Rybakov](https://github.com/koncopd). He leads `nbproject` and made core contributions to Scanpy & anndata, scArches & explainable autoencoders over the past years.

If you're interested in joining or collaborating, please [reach out](/contact)!

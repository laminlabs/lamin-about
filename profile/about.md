# About

## Why

We build the tools we wish we had.

We work on making data & analysis management for comp bio a lot more pleasant, robust, and effective.[^workspace]

We think this will enable biology more generally -- also for wet labs.[^vision]

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
[^workspace]: There are numerous data & analytics platforms for the wet lab.
    We focus on building a workspace for the dry lab.
[^vision]: Towards learning platforms for R&D that are integrated across wet â‡„ dry lab & human â‡„ artificial intelligence... ðŸ˜…

## What

Currently, we spend most of our time developing [open source data modules](/products) in private beta.
If you'd like to test them, please [reach out](/contact)!

Eventually, there will be a priced tier on top of open-source functionality.

Also, we offer a data & analysis platform solution to biotech companies.
If youâ€™re interested in becoming a beta customer, please [reach out](/contact)!

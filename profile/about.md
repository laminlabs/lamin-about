# About

## Why

We work on solving [key problems](/problems) of data-heavy R&D.
In recent years, they have become so severe that they block scientific progress.

Our vision is to enable learning platforms for R&D that are integrated across wet & dry lab and human & artificial intelligence.
And, if desired, allow collaborating on data across otherwise siloed organizations.

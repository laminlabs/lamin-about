# About

## Why

We build the tools we wish we had.

We want to make data & analysis management for computational biology a lot more pleasant, robust and effective.[^workspace]

We think this will enable biology more generally -- also for wet labs.[^vision]

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
[^workspace]: There are numerous data & analytics platforms for the wet lab.
    We focus on building a workspace for the dry lab.
[^vision]: Towards learning platforms for R&D that are integrated across wet â‡„ dry lab & human â‡„ artificial intelligence... ðŸ˜…

## What

Currently, we spend most of our time developing [open source tools](/products) in private beta.

With a smaller fraction of time, we consult biotech companies on building their data & compute platforms.

Eventually, we want to introduce a priced tier on top of open-source functionality.

## Team

We're a core team of 2 people:

- [Sunny Sun](https://github.com/sunnyosun): Biology across the dry and wet lab since 2012. Focus on genome engineering & cell biology in health & disease.
- [Alex Wolf](https://falexwolf.me): Scientific computing & software since 2009. Created Scanpy & led build-up of a compute platform for drug discovery.

## History

We started to write code for Lamin Labs in April 2022.

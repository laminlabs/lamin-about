# About

## Why

We build the tools we wish we had.

We want to make data & analysis management for computational biology a lot more pleasant, robust and effective.

We think this will enable biology more generally -- also for wet labs.[^1]

[^1]: Our vision is an integrated learning platform for R&D, including a workspace for the dry lab. 😅

## What

Currently, we spend most of our time developing [open source tools](/products) in private beta.

With a smaller fraction of time, we consult biotech companies on building their data & compute platforms.

Eventually, we want to introduce a priced tier on top of open-source functionality.

## Team

We're a core team of 2 people:

- [Sunny Sun](https://linkedin.com/in/sunnyosun): Biology across the dry and wet lab since 2012. Focus on genome engineering & cell biology in health & disease.
- [Alex Wolf](https://falexwolf.me): Scientific computing & software since 2009. Created Scanpy & led build-up of a compute platform for drug discovery.

If you're interested in joining or collaborating, please reach out via LinkedIn!

## History

We started to write code for Lamin Labs in April 2022.

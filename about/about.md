# About

## Why

In recent years, the growing complexity of R&D data has become so prohibitive that it often [blocks scientific progress](/problems).

We build [data infrastructure for biology](/docs), enabling data scientists and engineers with a shared data layer for R&D teams of any size.

We aim to do what git and GitHub did for code for R&D data and help integrate wet & dry labs, humans & AI, knowledge & data, and siloed teams & organizations.
